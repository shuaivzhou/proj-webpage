        In project 3-2, we add on to our PathTracer from 3-1. In part 1, we implemented the reflective and refractive properties of different materials to allow for generation of images made of these materials. In part 4, we implement the simulation of thin lens for the ability to render the depth of field effect in our images, allowing us to simulate the effect of real cameras.

            Point out the new multibounce effects that appear in each image. 
        </b></p>
        <p>
            At 0 bounces, we have no light bounces in our image. At 1 bounce, we see colors of the room but no real refraction or reflection in our spheres. At 2 bounces, we see the mirror effect of the left sphere, and the right sphere begins seeing some reflective properties. At 3 bounces, the sphere sees some change (roof becomes colored) and the right sphere begins exhibiting its refractive properties. At 4 bounces, the rays from the refracted sphere get shown in the mirrored effect of it in the left sphere as well as the light spot on the right blue wall. At 5 bounces, we see no significant changes, and the same is true for 100 bounces.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><b>
            Explain how these bounce numbers relate to the particular effects that appear. Make sure to include all screenshots.
        </b></p>
        <p>
            For 0 bounces, we only see the light source since there are no reflections that happen. When we get to 1 bounce, the colors of the room and the light on the black spheres are shown because we’re beginning to see the direct effect of light on its surroundings. Then, at 2 bounces, the room that was “generated” at 1 bounce gets shown in the left mirror sphere, and the right sphere sees small reflective properties. It is only at 3 bounces that we actually see the refractive properties of the right glass sphere, since the light needs to bounce within the sphere first before the light is refracted. At 3 bounces, we can also see the shadow of the glass sphere change according to its refractive properties. At 4 bounces, we see the secondary effects of the refractive sphere, i.e. the left mirror sphere begins reflecting the right spheres refractiveness, and the right wall has a spot of light from the sphere’s refraction. From there, at 5 bounces, if we zoomed in enough, we could perhaps see the right wall’s spot of light’s reflection in the left mirror sphere. However, there are few changes, and the same is true at 100 bounces. It is worth noting that the mirror sphere effectively reflects the changes to its surroundings one “step” late, i.e. changes at 2 bounces would be mirrored in the 3 bounces image.

        <h3 align="middle">Partner</h3>
        <p>
            We split the project up with Victor mainly working on part 1 and Minjune mainly working on part 4. We realized from previous projects that if we were stuck, sometimes it was helpful if the other person came in with a fresh mind having not worked with the first person, as this would provide a potentially new perspective. Thus, we helped each other debug whenever we were stuck. This project helped us learn a lot in that it added on to what we had from project 3-1, acting effectively as building blocks on top of each other in our learning.
